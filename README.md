login and view movies details

There is an sql file here (in root) that should be imported before running this application.
Along with that the config file should be update with the new database credentials.

1. If I had more time I would use a more elegant way to accept the form request for registering a user.
2. I would also use a select input to filter movies by their genre.
3. I would include more information on the display more view for a movie. For example the trailer except the image, along other information 
4. I would ensure that the html was responsive.
5. The JS files I refer to would be sitting on the server instead of being refered to via cdn, because some servers would not allow this.
6. I would include unit tests.
7. The forms' data would be encrypted and even more secure.
8. I would have enabled the capability to reset log in credentials.
9. I would add a quard to only allow logged in users to view movies.
10. I would have set up a proper migration using the command prompt commands for Laravel.
11. I would used a later version of angular but this was a simple enough task.
